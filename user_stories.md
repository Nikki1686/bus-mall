# User Story 1 - Woman ready to retire
As 60-year-old woman, I want to purchase something (like a cushion) that would make my
ride on the bus more comfortable. She is close to retirement and her body aches from 
walking around all day. Products that would soothe the body on a long journey would be 
most appealing to her.

# User Story 2 - Male Student
As 20-year-old male, I want to purchase products that may distract me during the commute.
Anything for entertainment, video games or wi-fi access for discounted price. Currently attending Code Fellows and could use the extra time to put in some more work on his salmon cookies project.

# User Story 3 - Middle Aged Man
As 45-year-old male, I want to purchase wi-fi access so I can stay on top of my sports teams during my daily commute to work. I would want access to ESPN so I could check out the latest scores from the other teams so I would know what my team standing is in the league. Avid Raiders fan, any sport team merchandise would intrigue me.

#User Story 4 - Young Professional Woman
As 25-year-old woman, I am barely getting started in my professional career and want to purchase any books that can help me progress in my career. Looking for books about finances and leadership. After all, she still has those student loans to pay off and she wants to find a way to pay them off sooner. David Ramsey books appeal most to her!
