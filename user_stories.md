# User Story 1 - Woman ready to retire
As 60-year-old grandmother, I want to purchase something (like the water can) that can help me water my garden at home. It can't just be any watering can, it has to be able to bend the water spout up or down and side to side. Afterall, some of my plants are in hard to reach places.

# User Story 2 - Male Student
As 20-year-old male, college student, I am always on the run. I want to purchase the banana slicer because it would cut some of the time it takes me to slice up bananas for my serial in half. 

# User Story 3 - Middle Aged Man
As 45-year-old male, married, two kids. I want to purchase something that could entertain me at home while I spend time in the bathroom. I would want access to ESPN so I could check out the latest scores from the other teams so I would know what my team standing is in the league. Maybe I could add a few games for kids as well. 

#User Story 4 - Young Professional Woman
As 25-year-old woman, I am barely getting started in my professional career and want to purchase the wine glass. After a long hard day at work, the thing I look forward to the most is relaxing at home with a good book and a nice glass of wine.
